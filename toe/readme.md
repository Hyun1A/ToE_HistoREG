## üöÄ Intallation

### Setup for experiments

**OS**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS

**Python**: 3.10.18

Install conda an enviroment
<pre>
conda create -n toe python=3.10.18
</pre>

Install pytorch
<pre>
pip install torch==2.3.0 torchvision==0.18.0 torchaudio==2.3.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
</pre>

Please install packages in requirements.txt
<pre>
pip install -r requirements.txt

## üíª Preparing tree labels and a pretrained model

### Constructing for tree labels
We already constructed the tree labels for training dataset saved in **data/tree_samples** from the root directory. If you want to regenerate them, please refer to **toe/construct_tree_labels**. For example, **toe/construct_tree_labelsconstruct_train_tree_dataset_lung.py** aims to construct the tree labels for training samples whose organ labels are "lung".

### Perparing slide encoder of Prism [1] (Perceiver) [2] 
Please pull the repository of [PRISM](https://huggingface.co/paige-ai/Prism) from huggingface and replace the empty "Prism" folder in **toe**. (The repository must be moved exactly as it is.)



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the scripts after specifying the directories of patch features, model path of PRISM, tree samples, and path to save slide features in `.sh` files. The options are:

<pre>
--aggregator_path ./Prism
--raw_feature_path {PATCH_PATH}
--val_anno_path ./data/val_samples.json
--feature_fn ./data/feature_cache/features_all.pt
--records_path ./data/tree_samples
</pre>
The option to specify in practice is `raw_feature_path`, the path to extracted patch features


### Train
<pre>
bash train_hier_cls_mlp.sh
</pre>


### Test
<pre>
bash test_hier_cls_mlp.sh
</pre>
